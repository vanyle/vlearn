# VToolbox

VToolbox is a C++ library containing all sort of stuff out of the box to make cool projects.
Every aspect of VToolbox is separated in a different folder.

VToolbox compiles to a static library (vtoolbox.a) that you can then link against.
When linking vtoolbox, you should also link with dbghelp on windows to access the debugging features.
